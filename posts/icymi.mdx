Jonathon Ng, formerly known by ‘The Eden Project’ moniker, has come a long way from his roots as a primarily electronic artist. He established himself online in the early 2010s, with music featuring heavily on YouTube under channels such as MrSuicideSheep and Koala Kontrol.

Quickly amassing an online following, he continued to release music and garner attention from all around the world, even from the likes of Illenium and Lorde.

With his eventual departure from the alias switching to the new shortened EDEN, his music quickly evolved towards a much more singer-songwriter focus with pop instrumentation, showcased by his first few projects like ‘End Credits’ and ‘i think you think too much of me’.

Over time however, he refined this sound, reintroducing parts from his earlier electronic material and even mixing in new more experimental elements. His debut album ‘vertigo’ acted as a culmination of EDEN’s journey up until now, addressing ideas about growing up with his music online, sacrificing relationships and wrestling with his inability to enjoy his success.

This pattern continued all the way through from ‘vertigo’, ‘no future’ and eventually now to ‘ICYMI’ (In Case You Missed It).

In an [interview](https://onestowatch.com/en/blog/eden-lives-in-his-memories-on-latest-album-icymi) prior to the album’s release, EDEN himself discussed the story of the album by saying:

> [I’m] much more interested in capturing the essence of what happened rather than the exact pragmatic details or sequence of events […] A big part of the album is kind of the interpolation of time and jumping from memory to memory, so it's definitely not a story album in a classical sense.

Interpreting memories by the feelings for them rather than the linearity of how they happened is a poignant and poetic sentiment, and one which I think is made clear after you listen to the album from beginning to end. He even mentions ‘Of course the past can be changed, I watched it bend while I talked’ in the track ‘Elsewhere’, which contends as one of my favourite songs from the album.

Musically speaking, this album really feels like the ‘vertigo 2.0’ of EDEN.
Though hearing glitchier and experimental factors in EDEN’s work now is not as surprising as it was when ‘vertigo’ was released, ICYMI acts like the other end of tunnel – a mastery of this blend of sounds and how they all coalesce.

Whether it’s the slow consistent drum patterns of ‘Modern Warfare’ swelling up until the final chorus, the pounding electronic synths from ‘Closer 2’ wrapping around you, or the sheer grandiose of a track like ‘Call Me Back’. Every instrumental feels so instantly recognisable as EDEN and yet no song feels like it is too similar or overly simplistic or washed out from itself or from one another.

It's hard to find the words to describe how fond I am of this album, and yet simultaneously it feels like I could talk forever about it.

In case you missed it, I’m a pretty big fan of this album, and you could be too.
