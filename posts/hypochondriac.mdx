‘hypochondriac’ is the second full-length album from self-acclaimed 'glitch-pop perfectionist' brakence.
Following his 2020 release of his debut album 'punk2', brakence delivers on hypochrondiac a much more cohesive and complete sound with hyper polished production and attuned vocal mastery.

Pieced together across 3-4 years, the narrative themes of the album cover his perspective into his own psyche and ego, exploring his struggles with depression, anxiety, fame, success, self-image, relationships, and internet addiction.

With its mixture of hyperpop melodies and glitchy distortion, coupled with math-rock pop-punk guitar riffs and intimate moments of stripped back piano chords. Everything about the production wraps together in a way which I can only describe to be claustrophobic but in the best way possible. Every expected pocket of space is filled with distortion here and an enigmatic sample there - even a cough and a scream at times to break things up.

Each new listen can reveal an intricate detail that was missed on previous listens, like finding easter eggs or collectibles in a videogame. While this rings true for all kinds of music, doing so with songs like the ones from ‘hypochondriac’ - which might have first seemed like a sea of unpredictable yet intoxicatingly pleasant melodies and harmonies, just feels all the more rewarding as a listener.

For me, I find it rare to ever come across an album that has such an innate sense that it was tailored and made-to-fit. Everything about this project feels utterly intentional and purposeful.

The way the themes of this album seem to bounce in and out constantly, demonstrating a realistic sense that this is brakence’s own stream of anxious consciousness, and moreso believable that this person is actually a hypochondriac.

Every small detail collides together on this album to create such a uniquely interesting and enjoyable experience.
